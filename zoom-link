Hi Bryan. I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to discuss the possibility of increasing my hourly salary by $50. I have been working on the project for the past two years, and I remain motivated to contribute and improve the product. However, I’ve noticed that there are currently not many tasks available for the desktop project. I believe it would be beneficial to establish a long-term roadmap, allowing for better planning and structured development.

I also want to acknowledge that, in the past, I have sometimes overestimated task efforts. Moving forward, I’m focused on refining my estimations and ensuring efficient progress. Additionally, I have several ideas for improving the project, but without assigned tasks, it has been challenging to implement them.

If there are other opportunities within the company, I’d be open to considering them as well. I have strong backend experience and would be happy to contribute in that area if needed.

Let me know if we can discuss this further. Looking forward to your thoughts.
