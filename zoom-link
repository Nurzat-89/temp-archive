Hi Brittany, yes I can explain. In these days I was working on fixing the SignalR issue. It was fixed and created new build. Also I made some investigation on Gainsight sending events from desktop. Also there was one task which I was working, currently we create a new version of build manually, we copy folder to OneDrive shared folder, and Bryan runs the signing by manually. This can be done in pipleine in automatic way. I think its necessray to quickly deploy a new version and test it by QA. So I setup the pipeline.

Regarding the SignalR issue, it took long time I agree, maybe I overestimated by working hours. It was difficult to reproduce it and investigate the log files from testes.
