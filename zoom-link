Hi Bryan. I hope you’re doing well. I’d like to discuss the possibility of increasing my hourly salary by $50. I have been working on the project for the past two years, and I remain motivated to contribute and improve the product. However, I’ve noticed that there are currently not many tasks available for the desktop project. I believe it would be beneficial to establish a long-term roadmap, allowing for better planning and structured development.

I also want to acknowledge that, in the past, I have sometimes overestimated task efforts. Moving forward, I’m focused on refining my estimations and ensuring efficient progress. Additionally, I have several ideas for improving the project, but without assigned tasks, it has been challenging to implement them.

If there are other opportunities within the company, I’d be open to considering them as well. I have strong backend experience and would be happy to contribute in that area if needed.

Let me know if we can discuss this further. Looking forward to your thoughts.



Here’s a structured breakdown of the Jira tasks and subtasks for setting up the Azure pipeline:

### **Task: Setup Azure Pipeline for Windows Desktop Application**  
**Description:**  
Automate the build process for the .NET Windows desktop application using Azure Pipeline. The pipeline should include steps for building, testing, creating an installation file, signing, and tagging new releases. A successful release should be automatically available for deployment.  

**Estimated Time:** 20 hours  

#### **Subtasks:**  

1. **Create Azure Pipeline YAML Configuration**  
   - Define the pipeline structure with stages: build, test, package, and sign.  
   - Configure necessary triggers for automatic execution.  
   - Ensure pipeline integrates with the source repository.  
   - **Estimation:** 5 hours  

2. **Setup Build and Test Stages**  
   - Define the build process using MSBuild.  
   - Integrate test execution (e.g., NUnit, MSTest).  
   - Ensure artifacts are properly stored for later stages.  
   - **Estimation:** 4 hours  

3. **Generate Installation File**  
   - Implement an automated process to package the application using Inno Setup or another installer.  
   - Store the installer as an artifact.  
   - **Estimation:** 3 hours  

4. **Implement Code Signing**  
   - Configure code signing with a valid certificate.  
   - Ensure proper security measures for certificate storage.  
   - Validate successful signing of the installation file.  
   - **Estimation:** 3 hours  

5. **Tagging and Release Management**  
   - Automate version tagging in the repository.  
   - Ensure new releases are automatically published with the correct version tag.  
   - **Estimation:** 3 hours  

6. **Verify and Test the Pipeline**  
   - Run end-to-end tests to validate the pipeline process.  
   - Fix any issues encountered.  
   - Ensure that the generated installation file works correctly.  
   - **Estimation:** 2 hours  

Would you like me to refine any parts or add dependencies between tasks?
