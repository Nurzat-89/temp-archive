You put time into this task, but no work has been done on this side, Please confirm what you have done on this task.


I apologize for any confusion. While I didn't work directly on this specific ticket, I did perform significant refactoring across the entire project. I wasn't sure where to allocate my hours for this general improvement work and chose this ticket as it seemed the most related.

If you prefer, I can reallocate the hours to a more appropriate task or a general maintenance ticket if one exists. Please let me know how you'd like me to proceed.

Thank you for your understanding.
