Hi Bryan,

I hope you are doing well. I would like to ask if it is possible to get a recommendation letter from Sourcepass for me. Just a short letter indicating that I work as a C# developer on the Sourcepass project in a part-time position would be sufficient. I can prepare a draft of the letter if you wish.

Thank you,
